## Introduction

This repository serves as a quick-start setup for new Mac users at Clair. It takes the effort out of installing everything manually. These scripts are run when your machine is first provisioned, but can be re-run if you want a fresh macOS install.

### Before you re-install

First, go through the checklist below to make sure you didn't forget anything before you wipe your hard drive.

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you remember to save all important documents from non-iCloud directories?
- Did you save all of your work from apps which aren't synced through iCloud?
- Did you remember to export important data from your local database?
- Did you update [mackup](https://github.com/lra/mackup) to the latest version and ran `mackup backup`?

### Installing macOS cleanly

After going through our checklist above and making sure you backed everything up, we're going to cleanly install macOS with the latest release. Follow [this article](https://www.imore.com/how-do-clean-install-macos) to cleanly install the latest macOS version.

### Setting up your Mac

If you did all of the above you may now follow these install instructions to setup a new Mac.

1. Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store
2. [Generate a new public and private SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) by running:

   ```zsh
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/driesvints/dotfiles/HEAD/ssh.sh | sh -s "<your-email-address>"
   ```

3. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles` with:

    ```zsh
    git clone git@github.com:driesvints/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    ```

4. Run the installation with:

    ```zsh
    ~/.dotfiles/fresh.sh
    ```

5. After mackup is synced with your cloud storage, restore preferences by running `mackup restore`
6. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

> 💡 You can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Make sure you also update the reference in the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc#L2) file.

You can tweak the shell theme, the Oh My Zsh settings and much more. Go through the files in this repo and tweak everything to your liking.

Enjoy your own Dotfiles!
